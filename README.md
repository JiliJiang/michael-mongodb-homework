# Usage
This project involves the building of back-end API database to manage social network applications using MongoDB. The database contains data of users, thoughts, friends, and reactions, which are associated with each other. The database provides RESTful APIs for front-end uses and web-development. In particular, it includes the bonus feature of deleting a user and all his or her associated thoughts at the same time.  The functions of this back-end database are demonstrated on Insomnia, as shown in the video provided below. 

# Feature
This back-end database uses express.js, MongoDB and Mongoose to build its structures and services for users to manage a social network application that users can friend each other, post thoughts and add reactions. In particular, the API routes are set up to include the bonus feature of deleting a user and all his or her associated thoughts at the same time.  In other words, if a user is deleted from the user API route, all his or her thoughts are also deleted from the thought API route.
